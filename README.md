# nCombat
Just a simple fun project I decided to make as a excercise.

## To-do List
Alpha:
- [ ] Make the timer not multiply its ticking speed each time the victim gets hit
- [ ] Reset the timer back to 5 on a new hit
- [ ] Find more efficient damage event
- [ ] Kill the player if they log off while in combat
- [ ] 
Beta:
- [ ] Make/find a icon for the plugin
- [ ] Fix /ncombat bypass
- [ ] Make timer, messages and log out action customizable

Release:
- [ ] Do not decrease timer while victim is running
- [ ] Add more subcommands
